# The next sections should be organized by module type (e.g. operators, hooks, functions, decorators, etc.).
#
# Within each section, the ``module`` value should be the path.to.the.module.specifically.
# For example, if the import path for a function is `from sample_provider.hooks.sample_hook import SampleHook` then the
# value should be "sample_provider.hooks.sample_hook.SampleHook".
